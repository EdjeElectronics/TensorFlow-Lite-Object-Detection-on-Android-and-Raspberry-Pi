# Part 2 - How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi (with Optional Coral USB Accelerator)

**Section 2 of this guide, which shows how to use the Coral USB Accelerator, is still under construction! Expected completion date: 10/22/19.** In the meantime, you can use the guide [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/raspberry_pi).

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for how to set up TensorFlow Lite on the Raspberry Pi and use it to run object detection models. It also shows how to set up the Coral USB Accelerator on the Pi and run Edge TPU detectopm models. It works for the Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 4 running either Rasbpian Buster or Rasbpian Stretch.

This guide is the second part of my larger TensorFlow Lite tutorial series:

1. [How to Train, Convert, and Run Custom TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on Windows 10](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi#part-1---how-to-train-convert-and-run-custom-tensorflow-lite-object-detection-models-on-windows-10)
2. How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi (with Optional Coral USB Accelerator) *<--- You are here!*
3. How to Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on Android Devices

TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models run much faster than regular TensorFlow models on the Raspberry Pi. You can see a comparison of framerates obtained using regular TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, and Coral USB Accelerator models in my TensorFlow Lite Performance Comparison YouTube video. *(link to be added later)*

This portion of the guide is split in to two sections:

* [Section 1. Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/blob/master/Raspberry_Pi_Guide.md#part-1---how-to-set-up-and-run-tensorflow-lite-object-detection-models-on-the-raspberry-pi)
* Section 2. Run Edge TPU Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi Using the Coral USB Accelerator

This repository also includes scripts for running the TFLite and Edge TPU models on images, videos, or webcam/Picamera feeds. I

## Section 1 - How to Set Up and Run TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi

Setting up TensorFlow Lite on the Raspberry Pi is much easier than regular TensorFlow! These are the steps needed to set up TensorFlow Lite:

1a. Update the Raspberry Pi and download this repository
1b. Install TensorFlow and OpenCV
1c. Set up TensorFlow Lite detection model
1d. Run TensorFlow Lite model!

### Step 1a. Update the Raspberry Pi and download this repository
First, the Raspberry Pi needs to be fully updated. Open a terminal and issue:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
Depending on how long it’s been since you’ve updated your Pi, the update could take anywhere between a minute and an hour. 

While we're at it, let's make sure the camera interface is enabled in the Raspberry Pi Configuration menu. Clickk the Pi icon in the top left corner of the screen, select Preferences -> Raspberry Pi Configuration, and go to the Interfaces tab and verify Camera is set to Enabled. If it isn't, enable it now, and reboot the Raspberry Pi.

</p>

Next, clone this GitHub repository by issuing the following command. The repository contains the scripts we'll use to run TensorFlow Lite, as well as a shell script that will make installing everything easier. Issue:

```
git clone https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi.git
```

This downloads everything into a folder called TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi. That's a little long to work with, so rename the folder to "tflite" and then cd into it:

```
mv TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi tflite
cd tflite
```

We'll work in this /home/pi/tflite directory for the rest of the guide.

### Step 1b. Install TensorFlow and OpenCV
Next, we'll install TensorFlow (which includes the TensorFlow Lite interpreter), OpenCV, and the package dependencies needed for both of them. OpenCV is not needed to run TensorFlow Lite, but the object detection scripts in this repository use it to grab images and draw detection results on them.

To make things easier, I wrote a shell script that will automatically download and install all the packages and dependencies. Run it by issuing:

```
bash get_pi_requirements.sh
```

Between OpenCV and TensorFlow, this downloads about 400MB worth of installation files. It will take a while, so go grab a cup of coffee while it's working! If you'd like to see everything that gets installed, simply open get_pi_requirements.sh to view the list of packages. 

Note: If you already had TensorFlow or OpenCV installed on your Pi, they will be updated to their latest versions after running this script. If you'd like to stick to a specific version of TensorFlow so it matches the version you trained your TFLite detection model with, you can use `pip3 install tensorflow==1.X.X`.

That was easy! On to the next step.

### Step 1c. Set up TensorFlow Lite detection model
Next, we'll set up the detection model that will be used with TensorFlow Lite. This guide shows how to either download a sample TFLite model provided by Google, or how to use a model that you've trained yourself by following [Part 1 of my TensorFlow Lite tutorial series](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi#part-1---how-to-train-convert-and-run-custom-tensorflow-lite-object-detection-models-on-windows-10).

A detection model has two files associated with it: a detect.tflite file (which is the model itself) and a labelmap.txt file (which provides a labelmap for the model). My preferred way to organize the model files is to create a folder (such as "BirdSquirrelRaccoon_TFLite_model") and keep both the detect.tflite and labelmap.txt in that folder. This is also how Google's downloadable sample TFLite model is organized.

#### Option 1. Using Google's sample TFLite model
Google provides a sample quantized SSDLite-MobileNet-v2 object detection model which is trained off the MSCOCO dataset and converted to run on TensorFlow Lite. It can detect and identify 80 different common objects, such as people, cars, cups, etc.

Download the sample model (which can be found on [the Object Detection page of the official TensorFlow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/object_detection/overview)) by issuing:

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/tflite/coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29.zip
```

Unzip it to a folder called "Sample_TFLite_model" by issuing (this command automatically creates the folder):

```
unzip coco_ssd_mobilenet_v1_1.0_quant_2018_06_29.zip -d Sample_TFLite_model
```

Okay, the sample model is all ready to go! 

#### Option 2: Using your own custom-trained model
You can also use a custom object detection model by moving the model folder into the /home/pi/tflite directory. If you followed [Part 1 of my TensorFlow Lite guide](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi#part-1---how-to-train-convert-and-run-custom-tensorflow-lite-object-detection-models-on-windows-10) to train and convert a TFLite model on your PC, you should have a folder named "TFLite_model" with a detect.tflite and labelmap.txt file. (It will also have a tflite_graph.pb and tflite_graph.pbtxt file, which are not needed by TensorFlow Lite but can be left in the folder.) 

You can simply copy that folder to a USB drive, insert the USB drive in your Raspberry Pi, and move the folder into the /home/pi/tflite directory. (Or you can email it to yourself, or put it on Google Drive, or do whatever your preferred method of file transfer is.) Here's an example of what my "BirdSquirrelRaccoon_TFLite_model" folder looks like in my /home/pi/tflite directory: 

*(Add picture of BirdSquirrelRaccoon_TFLite_model in my /home/pi/tflite directory)*

Now your custom model is ready to go!

### Step 1d. Run the TensorFlow Lite model!
It's time to see the TFLite object detection model in action! First, free up memory and processing power by closing any applications you aren't using. Also, make sure you have your webcam or Picamera plugged in.

Run the real-time webcam detection script by issuing:

```
python3 TFLite_detection_picamera.py --modeldir=Sample_TFLite_model
```

Note: The TFLite_detection_picamera.py will work with either a Picamera or a USB webcam. It is actually going to be removed from this repository, and I will instruct people to use TFLite_detection_webcam.py instead. However, I need to add instructions to my main guide telling people to download and install the TFLite runtime first. This will all be cleared up by the end of the day!!

(If your model folder has a different name than "Sample_TFLite_model", use that name instead. For example, I would use `--modeldir=BirdSquirrelRaccoon_TFLite_model` to run my custom bird, squirrel, and raccoon detection model.)

After a few moments of initializing, a window will appear showing the webcam feed. Detected objects will have bounding boxes and labels displayed on them in real time.

*(Add gif of object detector in action here?)*

Part 1 of my TensorFlow Lite training guide gives [instructions](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi#video) for using the TFLite_detection_image.py and TFLite_detection_video.py scripts. Make sure to use `python3` rather than `python` when running the scripts.

## Section 2 - Run Edge TPU Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi Using the Coral USB Accelerator
The [Coral USB Accelerator](https://coral.withgoogle.com/products/accelerator/) is a USB hardware accessory for speeding up TensorFlow models. You can buy one [here (Amazon Associate link)](https://amzn.to/2BuG1Tv). 

*(Add picture of USB Accelerator and the Edge TPU chip)*

The USB Accelerator uses the Edge TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), which is an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chip specially designed with highly parallelized ALUs (arithmetic logic units). While GPUs (graphics processing units) also have many parallelized ALUs, the TPU has one key difference: the ALUs are directly connected to eachother. The output of one ALU can be directly passed to the input of the next ALU without having to be stored and retrieved from a memory buffer. The extreme paralellization and removal of the memory bottleneck means it can perform up to 4 trillion arithmetic operations per second! This is perfect for running deep neural networks, which require millions of multiply-accumulate operations to generate outputs from a single batch of input data. 

My Master's degree was in ASIC design, so the Edge TPU is very interesting to me! If you're a computer architecture nerd like me and want to learn more about the Edge TPU, [here is a great article that explains how it works](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/what-makes-tpus-fine-tuned-for-deep-learning).

It makes object detection models run WAY faster, and it's easy to set up. These are the steps we'll go through to set up the Coral USB Accelerator:
